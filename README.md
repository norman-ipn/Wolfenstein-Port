Wolfenstein-Port
================

Wolfenstein-Port will be the GTK+ 3.0 port of the Wolfenstein video game.
The porting is in progress and is meant to be the final project 
on the Computer Graphics course at E.S.COM. I.P.N. The developers
are students guided by me, the professor of the course. 
The objetive is to analize the way the computer graphics used on the days
of Wolfenstein were programmed and to update the graphics using the knowledge 
acquired during the course.

Environment
-----------

The port is being tested on linux machines, mainly on Ubuntu distributions.
The installation of gtk 3.0 is mandatory, so the use of the traditional Makefile.

    make 
    make clean
    make run
